It's a variation of 01 knapsack.
In Unbounded there's no limitation on how many times a item can be picked

In terms of code,
we use the n-1 element until solution is possible and we move on only if we don't need it.

Algo:

       if(wt[n-1]<=W){//check if we can pick the last item
           return  max(val[n-1]+knapSack(W-wt[n-1],wt,val,n),knapSack(W,wt,val,n-1));//try out both the option
		//notice we didn't decrement n to n-1, we will continue picking it up until it's an option
       }
       else
        return knapSack(W,wt,val,n-1);//move to next if can't pick the this item
