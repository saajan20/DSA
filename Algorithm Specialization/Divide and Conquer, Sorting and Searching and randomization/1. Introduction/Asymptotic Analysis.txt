This is the language, by which every serious computer programmer and computer scientist,
discusses, the high level performance, of computer algorithms.

it identifies a sweet spot for discussing the high level performance of algorithms. 
What I mean by that, is it is on the one hand, coarse enough, to suppress all of the 
details that you want to ignore. Details that depend on the choice of architecture, the 
choice of programming language, the choice of compiler, and so on.

On the other hand it's sharp enough to be useful. In particular, to make predictive 
comparisons between different high level algorithmic approaches to solving a common 
problem. This is going to be especially true for large inputs.
