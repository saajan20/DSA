 for(i=1;i<n;i++)// unsorted part
      {   
          in=i; //current element
          j=i-1;//greatest element of the sorted part
	
		while(j>=0 && a[j] >a[in]){ 	//traversing the sorted slot from the back
		swap(a[j--],a[in--]); 		//if the element in the sorted part is greater than the current element swap it.
		}		
      }

idea: To have two slots one sorted and other un sorted,
we loop over the unsorted part and place each element one by one to the sorted part.
